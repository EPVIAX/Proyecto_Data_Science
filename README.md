## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. The libraries used are:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:
1. What are the most popular programming languages in 2017?
2. What are the most popular programming languages in 2018?
3. What are the most popular programming languages in 2019?
4. What are the most popular programming languages in 2020?

## File Descriptions
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josemiguelgarcia_41624/what-are-the-most-popular-programming-languages-in-2020-7b3b1f1b3b3d).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Stack Overflow link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
